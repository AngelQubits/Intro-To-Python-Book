print("Differences: \n" 
      "1. Tuples are referenced quicker by python than lists, "
      "because tuples are immutable,(i.e. they stay the same.) \n"
      "2. lists are mutable and tuples are immutable. \n"
      "3. There is a syntax difference in that lists use [ ], and tuples "
      " use ( ) \n"

#similarities:

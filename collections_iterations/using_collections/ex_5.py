# string - yes
# tuple - yes
# list - yes
# dict - yes
# range - no
# dict - yes
# int - yes
# float - yes
# frozenset - yes

#range can't be used because it does not return a value on its own.

#solution:
#mutability matters, lists, dicts, and sets are all mutable and cant
# be used as dict key.  Only immmutable objects can be used as dict keys.

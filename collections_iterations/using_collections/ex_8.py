# Line 3: prints 8, because it is first slicing the string, creating a
# new text sequence, then it is locating the highest indexed 'f' in that 
#newly sliced segment.

# Line 4 is using the rfind method for the full string 'text'. It is 
# looking for the highest indexed 'f' between the 21st and 35th index.
